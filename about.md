Hi, my name is Jorge Gonz√°lez and I'm a web developer from Mexico City. I am an expert at developing, designing and maintaining RESTful APIs as well as a wide range of web applications for all sorts of clients.

I am an alumni of [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) which is a three-month educational retreat for programmers. The biggest take-away for me besides metteing awesome people was realizing that programming languages are just a tool and you have to focus more on solving problems instead of picking the "right language". This is why I believe on picking the right tool for the job and I often find myself going back and forward between ruby, python, javascript and php.
